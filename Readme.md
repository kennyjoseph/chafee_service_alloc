# Details

All modeling work can be replicated by running the code in ```run_models.ipynb```. However, you must first access the relevant NDACAN datasets; see the [NDACAN website](https://www.ndacan.acf.hhs.gov/) for details on how to access them.

Prediction results from our run can be found in ```preds_2018_g.csv.gz```, if you unzip this, you can then use the ```R``` files (besides ```util.R```) to replicate all plots presented in the paper.
